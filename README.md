Some DrawBot scripts

To install the `drafting` package in DrawBot itself:

- `Python` > `Install Python Packages...`
- Change "Search" to "Install/Upgrade"
- Type in `drafting`
- Hit Enter or `Go!`
- (If there's an error about fontTools, that's not important, but when it's done it should say something like `Successfully installed drafting-0.0.3 fontPens-0.2.4 fonttools-4.21.1 more-itertools-8.7.0 skia-pathops-0.6.0.post2` (exact numbers aren't important))
